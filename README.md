# Nimbus Sans OT D
## It's a font I like, but isn't very popular
So I tried to download what font files did exist and [used the nerd font patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts?tab=readme-ov-file#font-patcher) to use it for everything but source code.
I favor the "Hack" [nerd font](https://www.programmingfonts.org/#hack) for source code, but doesn't everyone.

Anyways, there's two different versions of the font.
The one directly in `font-files/` is a much smaller download, so it's more suitable for web font-faces.
The other ones in `font-files/nerd/` are more reasonable to be installed locally and then used for whatever you want.

I uhhh made this repository as a kid so idrk what was happening, but we're so back now.
